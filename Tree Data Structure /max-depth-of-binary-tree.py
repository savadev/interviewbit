'''
Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth of a binary tree is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

 NOTE : The path has to end on a leaf node.
Example :

         1
        /
       2
max depth = 2.

# Definition for a  binary tree node

#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    # @param A : root node of tree
    # @return an integer
    def maxDepth(self, A):
        if A is None:
            return 0
        dl = self.maxDepth(A.left)
        dr = self.maxDepth(A.right)
        return max(dl, dr) + 1
